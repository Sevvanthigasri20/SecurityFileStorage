Secure File Storage: A Flask-Based Encryption & Decryption Web Application
Project Overview
This project presents a web-based application built with Flask and Python that provides a secure and user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting files. Leveraging the robust cryptography library, this system ensures the confidentiality of sensitive data by allowing users to securely manage their files directly through a web browser.
What This App Does
This is a simple website that helps you keep your files safe. You can use it to:

Lock (Encrypt) Your Files: Turn your regular files (like photos, documents) into secret, unreadable files.
Unlock (Decrypt) Your Files: Turn those secret files back into their original, readable form.
It's all done securely using Python and Flask, right in your web browser!

Why I Made It
To learn how to build secure web applications.
To understand how to protect files using encryption.
To create a simple tool for managing sensitive files.

How It Works
Secret Key: It uses a special "secret key" to lock and unlock files. This key is kept safe and is not shared publicly.
Web Interface: You upload files directly on the website to encrypt or decrypt them.
Safe Code: I've made sure that temporary files and my secret key are not put on GitHub by mistake.

What I Used
Python: The main programming language.
Flask: A tool in Python to build the website.
Cryptography: A special Python library to do the strong locking and unlocking.
Git & GitHub: To manage and save my code online.
